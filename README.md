# Work on Wheels 

## About

Welcome to Work on Wheels, a web application designed to help those who work remotely to find campsites that have internet access so they can work on the road while they travel!

With Work on Wheels, users can browse a list of campsites that have access to the internet. Users are also able to favorite campsites that they have or want to visit and view all their selected favorites on a seperate page. They can click on any campsite card to view more detailed information about the campsite.
